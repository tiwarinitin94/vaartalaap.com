    Hello everyone, This is Nitin Tiwari from Vaartalaap. This is the site that I builded up for showing the creative side of my own initially. But now I would like to provide this power to each end everyone.
	We all make conversation with person that we see or we don't see, but with the help of social media, we can share everything with everyone. I believe that everyone has a creative side, which they can express
	by their face or voice or by writting it down. So I am working towards creating some tools that will help them to express. <br> 
	<br> 
	Soon there will be some amazing that you all will like, we have developed a game area, where games will bring other side of yours. Sometimes we ourselves unable to find the price of our talent. So all of these 
	will be there to help you all. The videos that we will accept will be moderate by our crew, if that video is not copied from other website, then we will publish it to our website. It will allow others to see your 
	real work and creativity. 
	<br><br>
	Playing games are my favorite thing when I get depressed. And whenever I score high in some tough games, I always feel nice and motivated. I feel that we all need some simple for understanding and tough for playing games. 
	These games also help us growing our senses. So we should play all those small games that help us to focus more. 
	<br>
	<br> 
	I am also expecting so many feedbacks from people. I would like to here from you all, which kind of games would like to see or videos you would like to share and stuff. You all can send me your feedback in feedback section.
